# `algo_py` directory

**Warning** now `algopy` is `algo_py` (a module named `algopy` already exists in Python...)

## Utilisation

To import the module `xxx.py`

    from algo_py import xxx


- either the file containing the import is in the same directory as `algo_py`
- either `algo_py` has been added to the "Python path" (recommended)
